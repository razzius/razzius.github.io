# Concepts

## Eventually

Email address you send your event emails to, which creates calendar event invites from the email text. Turn mailing lists into calendars. Browse events that are only communicated through email.

Could use a better title.

## Myra

Personal recipe book. Keep track of recipes you like, group recipes into cookbooks, and see what you can cook with what you have on hand.

## FriendLend

List your possessions that you're willing to lend out (sleeping bag, guitar) and keep track of who's borrowing them. Use as a personal belongings website. Make recommendations about the things you own - these shoes are great, this appliance is disappointing.
