# I oppose the sale of .org to Ethos Capital

Public Interest Registry (PIR) is the organization that manages the .org
top-level domain. The Internet Society (ISOC), a nonprofit organization, created
PIR in 2002 and was its parent company until November 2019, when ISOC announced
the sale of PIR to Ethos Capital for $1.135 billion, a private equity investment
firm founded in 2019. PIR, which was established as a nonprofit subsequently
announced that it would cease to be a nonprofit and become a B Corporation.

Organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) have voiced
concerns with the sale, such as the fact that Ethos could raise the annual
registration fees charged by PIR; it would have an incentive to do so, having
paid so much for PIR, and having financed the purchase with $360 million in loans.
Ethos has made a non-binding commitment to not increase fees "by more than 10%
per year on average."

"On average"? What does that even mean? Is that an average across .org domains,
or across multiple years? Might they increase a domain's price by 100% in one
year, and then not raise its price for nine? By 1,000%, and not raise its price
for 99 years?

They wouldn't even need to resort to such tricks to reap a hefty profit at the
expense of .org customers; increasing the price by 10% anually doubles the cost
every 8 years (log(2) / log(1.1) = 7.27). PIR has already operated .org for 16
years, and could operate it for decades more; even relatively slow exponent
growth would harm .org registrants.

Keeping the .org prices steady, as has been the case for several years, has
increased access for nonprofit organizations to owning domains, which is in the
public interest. In my opinion, this is what the Public Interest Registry should
be about.

## Online Debate On The Sale

To the credit of those supportive of the sale, they have engaged in public
discourse about why they believe it is a good idea to sell PIR and .org to
private equity, beyond the obvious financial windfall of a $1.135 billion sale
price for ISOC. I found one set of arguments, by Mike Godwin, a board member of
ISOC, particularly questionable, in the article ["Here's How We Can Truly
#SaveDotOrg"](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20200114_here_is_how_we_can_truly_savedotorg/).
I will contest them here.

### Argument: Raising .org domain name renewal prices would cause mass migrations off of .org

> But could it be at the public's expense? What about the argument that the prices for domain-name renewals will soar? This argument ignores common sense — you don't take over a successful business and price most of your customers out of the market or spur a mass migration to an alternative product. Not only would that permanently destroy any faith in .ORG — the business you just bought — but it also would undermine TLDs generally. (I've suggested, not entirely jokingly, that the proper response if anybody tries to extort huge renewal fees for .ORG is to launch a mass one-time conversion to the .WTF top-level domain. I'd happily lead any charge in the .WTF Resistance.) In any case, demand for TLDs isn't inelastic, despite what the deal's critics say — there are hundreds of TLDs and customers aren't locked in.

Mike Godwin has written, "not entirely jokingly", that the proper response in the
case of a registrar hiking fees exorbitantly is to mass migrate from .org to
the .WTF top-level domain.

Imagine this happened, and an internet user, looking for information on The
Sierra Club (https://www.sierraclub.org/), sees a result for
https://www.sierraclub.wtf. Something that looks like the information one is
seeking with a slightly different domain name is a huge red flag. Would the user
still be as inclined to donate, their donation receipts coming from
sierraclub.wtf?

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which
administers generic top-level domains (gTLDs, such as .com, .net, and .org)
hosts its site at icann.org; I bought [icann.wtf](http://icann.wtf) for $4.06.

Organizations that have had .org domains for dozens of years, like wikipedia.org
and icann.org, derive immense value from the maintenance of their historical
.org website. They are almost completely insensitive to price. It would be a sad
future if PIR held wikipedia.org hostage, causing donations to Wikimedia to flow
from Wikimedia, the nonprofit that operates Wikipedia, to PIR, to private
equity, to the investment vehicles of Republican billionares [such as Ross Perot
and Mitt Romney](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/26/org_selloff_internet/).
But Wikimedia paying millions to keep wikipedia.org is still better than
wikipedia.org transitioning to wikipedia.wtf or some other TLD, and the
original wikipedia.org domain becoming a spam farm.

Further complicating things is the fact that .ngo and .ong are also assigned to
PIR. .ngo is the obvious extensions for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in
English, and .ong for French, Spanish, Italian and other Romance languages. So
the logical next choices of many organizations for switching off of .org have
the same issues.

### Argument: TLDs may fade away entirely

> I've also been haunted by my uncertainty as to how long we will have today's domain-name system with us. I'm 63, but it seems possible that even within my lifetime, the TLD system will grow, change unrecognizably, or even fade away entirely. Certain choices by ICANN leading to proliferating TLDs plus the growth of search engines and mobile device apps that don't need TLDs to find things (plus, also, the possibility that Internet-of-Things and other developments may marginalize TLDs altogether) make the future of TLDs hard to predict no matter what we choose today. Most likely, in my view, is that if we have TLDs around in 20 years or 50 years [...]

Domains are not going anywhere. Sure, mobile apps and IoT may put the domain
name resolving requests out of view, but almost every nontrivial mobile app has a web backend accessed by domain name, and it's a standard practice in IoT to resolve servers via domain name.

In fact, mobile apps and IoT are just another reason domain demand is inelastic
to pricing; after deploying millions of applications / devices that expect to
retrieve resources from a domain name, organizations would be loathe to break
their existing install base by releasing their domain name.

In addition, though mobile apps and IoT are changing the landscape,
old-fashioned web sites have stood the test of time, and will continue to do so.
I personally hope that peer-to-peer networking chips away at the bottleneck of
domain names and ICANN, but it's not going to happen anytime soon, and it will
not be a complete replacement.

## Additional Arguments opposing the sale

On the other side of the discussion, here are some articles critical of the deal that I recommend reading.

- [Part I: Who Pays When .Org Prices Rise?](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20200116_part_i_who_pays_when_dot_org_prices_rise/)
- [ICANN Needs To Ask More Questions About the Sale of .ORG](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/icann-needs-ask-more-questions-about-sale-org)

## What To Do About This

[Sign the EFF Petition "Help stop the sale of Public Interest Registry to a Private Equity Firm"](https://savedotorg.org/).

If you have a US representative, tell them you oppose this deal.

There will be a protest at ICANN today, January 24th, from 9 to 11 am. I hope that individuals and organizations continue to put pressure on ICANN to halt the deal; As [the letter from US lawmakers](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.01.16%20Letter%20to%20ICANN%20about%20sale%20of%20.ORG%20registry.pdf) points out, ICANN has a choice to withold consent in this transfer of a registry operator.

## Alternatives to selling .org to private equity

ISOC, a nonprofit, owning PIR, also being a nonprofit, has worked fine for many
years at this point. Them operating the domain for public benefit seems sensible
to me, but since they have shown that they would be happier with .org in private
hands, it makes sense to find another nonprofit to operate .org.

[Cooperative Corporation of dot-org Registrants (CCOR)](https://www.ccor.org/)
is one such nonprofit seeking to represent the community of .org domain name
registrants. [Mike Godwin argues against this option](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20200114_here_is_how_we_can_truly_savedotorg/):

> Another alternative future (other critics have embraced) would be for ICANN somehow to extra-legally end its contract with ISOC and hand over management of .ORG to a new consortium with even less capital (and that would deliberately accumulate less) and even less experience in stewardship of .ORG — transitioning .ORG from one parasitical relationship to a worse one, with less money to improve and maintain .ORG.

However, I find the this argument has the following flaws:
- Afilias implements the technical functions of the domain, which wouldn't have
  to change under CCOR or another new nonprofit.
- PIR was once a new organization; Ethos Capital is also newly formed.
- We have seen that operating .org in the public interest, not for profit
  ("deliberately accumulate less [capital]"), can work for .org customers.

PIR is currently producing a surplus from its domain name registration fees; if
things were to stay in the pre-deal form, perhaps they should be lowering .org
fees, or eliminating them, such as in the case of the [2011 Tohoku earthquake
and tsunami](https://mashable.com/2011/04/11/japan-org-websites/).

It's troubing to imagine a future with .org belonging to a debt-burdened
for-profit corporation. Let's not let it happen.
