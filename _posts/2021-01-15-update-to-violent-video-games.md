title: Update on violent video games

Just about 3 years ago I wrote the post ["I'm quitting violent video games"](/2018/01/19/i'm-quitting-violent-video-games.html), and I'm letting myself play Wow Classic tonight because I feel like it. I also saw a post ["Ten-Year Long Study Confirms No Link Between Playing Violent Video Games as Early as Ten Years Old and Aggressive Behavior Later in Life"](https://gamesage.net/blogs/news/ten-year-long-study-confirms-no-link-between-playing-violent-video-games-as-early-as-ten-years-old-and-aggressive-behavior-later-in-life), and while that's not quite refuting my original point, it's hopeful that gaming doesn't seem to cause aggressive behavior.

This probably deserves more thought and its own post, but I don't want to be defining myself by what I don't do, or judging others for what they do. I'd rather do things that I think are worth doing and not beat myself up about what I enjoy or do to relax. I think it's cool to bike or take the train, and it's ok to drive a car or take a plane.
