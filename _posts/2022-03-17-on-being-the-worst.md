I just finished reading Tina Fey's *Bossypants* and a couple weeks ago I read Abbi Jacobson's *I Might Regret This*. I recommend both.

Interestingly, both of them claim to be "the worst"; Abbi because she adopted a dog only to return it within a week following a breakup, and Tina because... something, I can't remember, even though I have the book out right in front of me. I'm the worst.

But they can't *both* be the worst, now, can they? Unless Tina was the worst at the time (2011) and then Abbi became the worst sometime leading up to the 2018 publishing of her book. If so, rest easy Tina, you've been unseated.

I've heard that happiness is expecation minus reality. If you decide yourself be "the worst" and are ok with that, things can only go up from there. There's no expectations of self, if you're the worst.

I also think of a clip from a documentary where celebrated filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki makes food for the team during the production of Spirited Away. He calls his meal "cheap salty ramen" and sure enough, it's based on 10 packs of instant noodles. He sets the bar low, and when it turns out good, there are smiles all around!
