# Baklava Recipe

This is my favorite special occasion dessert. It's an unusual recipe for me; it requires special ingredients and lots of time and care. The upside is that it's delicious and lasts a while, making it great for gifts.

## Rough outline:

Preheat **oven to 325**, make **syrup**, make **nut filling**, layer **phyllo dough with butter**, add filling, **freeze**, **cut**, **bake**, **pour syrup**.

Note that you *freeze* before you cut, cut *before* you bake, and you bake *before* you add syrup. It seems weird but it's true.

## Ingredients:

### Pastry base
- 20 sheets phyllo dough (some boxes have 2 rolls of 20 sheets packaged separately; make 2 pans or freeze 1 for later)
- 1/2 cup **UNSALTED** butter (for vegan use vegan butter)

### Nut filling
- 3 cups nuts (I use 2c almonds 1c walnuts, pistachios also work)
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves

### Syrup
- 2 sticks cinnamon
- 5 whole cloves
- (*optional*) 1/4 cup honey
- 1c sugar
- 1c water
- 1 lemon

## Equipment:

- pastry brush (I don't have one lol I use a fork)
- 8x11 inch pan
- optional cupcake tissue papers to make single servings easy
- 2 saucepans

## Instructions:

Defrost phyllo dough in fridge for 2-3 hours. While the phyllo dough defrosts, make the nut filling. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Lay 1 sheet of phyllo dough, cover it thinly with butter. After 9 sheets, spread half the nut mix across the pan. Very delicately, lay 2 more sheets, spreading butter very gently. Spread the rest of the nut mix. Add the final 9 sheets.

Put in the freezer for 10 minutes, so that the butter solidifies and it's easy to cut. Take it out and cut diagonally across the pan with a knife the long way, then straight lines the short way. Put in the oven for an hour. Take it out and pour the syrup across the baklava. Let it cool down and harden, an hour at least, put it in the fridge to make it go faster.

## Thanks

Thanks to my dad for the recipe, editing my edition, and of course making me and my friends tray after tray of baklava over the years.

شكرا!
