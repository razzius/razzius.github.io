# Mousa's Hummus Recipe

<img src="/img/mousas_hummus.jpg" width=400>

Hummus is healthy and simple, vegan and gluten free.
I've made it a few times, but I forgot how to make it tasty. Luckily my cousin Mousa showed me his way, and tasty is back.
All the ingredients are shelf-stable and only the lemon and garlic are perishable.

## Ingredients:

- 1 can chickpeas (3 1/2 servings of 1/2 cups)
- 1 heaping teaspoon cumin
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 lemon
- olive oil
- salt
- (optional) ground sumac for garnish

## Instructions:

Put the can of chickpeas, liquid and all, into a bowl and microwave it for about 3 minutes, until it is steaming.

Squeeze a large lemon; potent lemons work best.

Put the chickpeas into a food processor.

Add less than a teaspoon of salt; this one's a bit tricky since some chickpeas come with salt. Start small; you can add more later.

Add the lemon to the food processor, and give it a spin.

Add a heaping spoon of cumin.

Crush 2 fresh cloves of garlic and add it to the food processor.

Blend it again. Give it a taste.

Add a light layer of olive oil.

Now to add the tahini, which can change the consistency.
The tahini at the bottom is drier, and the oil at the top is more liquid.

Add a layer to cover the surface of the food processor, and blend it again.

At this point it could be done; you can also add tahini, olive oil, and salt to taste.

Transfer to a bowl and add a bit of ground sumac and olive oil as a garnish.

I credit my cousin, Mousa Abuissa, for the recipe!

Serving suggestion: slice cucumber into circles, slice pita like pizza, make carrot sticks.
