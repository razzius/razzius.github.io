title: Switching from pyenv to pv

pv isn't done yet. But here's its cli:

pv
{
  "pv-version": 0.0.1,
  "python-version": 3.8.0
}
pv latest
python --version
3.8.1

no "latest" command
Shim-style tool
- makes these files that are pyenv specific
- mypy command not found and exists in other versions

- does not coexist with brew

use pipx
